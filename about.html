                            <h2>My Story</h2>
                            <p>I’m currently living in Atlanta, GA, but am originally from Los Angeles, CA. My design background started in forums as a pre-teen, making custom signature graphics for users on DeviantArt and other various forums centered around my eclectic interests (probably on a torrented download of Photoshop; don’t tell Adobe). Even before then, I was an artistic child as I was very much into drawing my favorite cartoons or VHS tape covers. This later translated to me taking up new media art in college. During those years I channeled my inner designer with my clothing line, inFini. From the age of 4 (or basically since I could walk) up until my junior year of high school I ran track. I played football from the age of 12 until my second year in college. For all of my life I have been an avid gamer, finding more interest in indie games but also playing some major titles (Gears of War would be my favorite AAA game). In my spare time, you can find me either at the skatepark, in the cinema or on my couch catching up on the latest films and shows, walking my dog, or somewhere reading.</p>
                            <p>In my experience, I’ve worked in multiple design roles around my state and the southeast US. I got my start after college working as a Marketing Specialist for local government, creating graphics for, and managing, their social media accounts. After that I was the Lead Graphic Designer for a mid-sized promotional products business and was able to add custom logos and graphics to their business model. Finally, I have been a freelancing graphic designer, providing design solutions to organizations small and large across the US, with clients from Colorado to New Jersey.</p>
