            <p>Creating a central and social responsive website for food lovers to interact and search for recipes was the main reason for FoodCoâ€™s creation. Using user research and an iterative design approach, I was able to create mobile, tablet, and web wireframes using Figma.</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>To better understand the needs of our users, research was done on both competitor websites and user analytics. Most competitor sites resembled each other, offering a surplus of information that often overwhelmed the screen. User data told us that there is high reliance on websites for users to find their recipes and also an increase in interest due to being able to share images of their food.</p>

                <h2>Ideation</h2>
                <p>The idea of FoodCo came from the lack of a social space online for those who love food in all its forms, from just looking at dishes, cooking, baking, or learning about ingredients. FoodCo strives to become the central hub for everything food and recipe adjacent by not only allowing its user to upload recipes, but also to interact with other users in various ways. To display the idea of the website, there were two key user flows that were developed to show the MVP of the product.</p>

                <h2>Wireframes</h2>
                <p>Wireframing took on three main stages, as it often does in other UI design processes. The initial low-fidelity screens were drawn on paper for each breakpoint of mobile, tablet, and web. Those wireframes were then digitized, adding shadow boxes, placeholders and some basic buttons to be able to test their usability and gather a first round of feedback. Finally, once I had critique from conducting user tests, further customization of buttons, grid systems, and design patterns were added to the last, high-fidelity wireframes.</p>

                </picture>
                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>Before implementing the final touches of design to the high-fidelity screens, I created a moodboard that consisted of a color scheme, typography, and imagery. With the final screens of all breakpoints finally made, these were added to the high-fidelity wireframes. Placeholder text was replaced with actual copy. An iconography set was chosen and added to match the theme set out in the mood board. Lastly, imagery was input into places where shadow boxes had connoted that pictures would be.</p>

            <div class="row"><!-- Prototype -->

                </picture>
                <h2>Protoype</h2>
                <p>To then test our final designs of the responsive website, a couple prototypes were created with both sets of screens that were designed to display the MVP of the website: viewing and saving a recipe as a favorite was the first, and posting a recipe was the second. Both of these prototypes were tested with a new set of participants. The feedback we got from this round of testing gave us crucial insight into not only the usability of our product but also the design. Some of the critique led us to iterate another version of our design, even changing the color scheme of our website. </p>

                <h2>Mockups</h2>
                <p>Showing how the website looks on devices was the final step in the experience and design process. This allowed our product to take on a realer existence and showcase how and where the website could be housed and used.</p>
